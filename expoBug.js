While working with Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual issue where the development server would intermittently crash without any apparent error messages in the console. This would occur randomly during development, often after making seemingly innocuous code changes.  The application would become unresponsive, requiring a manual restart of the Expo CLI server. This behavior was inconsistent and difficult to debug, as there were no clear error indicators to pinpoint the root cause.
