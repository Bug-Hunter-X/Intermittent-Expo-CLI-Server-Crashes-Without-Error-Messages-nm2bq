The solution to this problem involved a detailed review of the project's dependencies and code to identify potential sources of unexpected behavior. In this simplified example, there is no obvious problematic code.  However, the most likely cause for this type of crash in larger projects is related to asynchronous operations that may cause memory leaks, unhandled exceptions, or race conditions.

The `expoBugSolution.js` file demonstrates how using improved error handling and more controlled asynchronous operations, along with potentially updating certain packages to newer versions, can significantly increase the stability of the Expo CLI server and decrease this type of crash.  This would involve checking for error conditions throughout the codebase, utilizing async/await to handle asynchronous operations more elegantly, and ensuring all exceptions are properly caught. Additional logging could also help in debugging future problems.
